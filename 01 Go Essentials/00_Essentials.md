## Go Rules

- double qutes ""
- := keyword : used when declaring a variable where the type should be inferred by Go
  example using := keyword:
  helloWorld := "Hello World"
  example using = keyword:
  var helloWorld string = "Hello World"
- func - defining functions

#### Packages

- package main : tells Go which one is main module
- fmt (the Format package): one of many go packages that holds many helpful functions such as Print
- math

#### Functions

- main() - tells Go where the execution starts

- fmt.Print() - console log, no line break
- fmt.Println() - console log with line break
- fmt.Printf() - console log formatted string
- fmt.Sprint() - returns string
- fmt.Springf() - returns formatted string
- fmt.Scan() - scans for user input on terminal
  - pointer (&) - points to a variable for storing user input
    \*Limitations - Can't take multiple words input.
- math.Pow() - power \*\* in other languages

## Go Types & Null Values

### Basic Types

- Go comes with a couple of built-in basic types:

  int => A number WITHOUT decimal places (e.g., -5, 10, 12 etc)
  float64 => A number WITH decimal places (e.g., -5.2, 10.123, 12.9 etc)
  string => A text value (created via double quotes or backticks: "Hello World", `Hi everyone')
  bool => true or false

- But there also are some noteworthy "niche" basic types which you'll typically not need that often but which you should still know about:

  uint => An unsigned integer which means a strictly non-negative integer (e.g., 0, 10, 255 etc)
  int32 => A 32-bit signed integer, which is an integer with a specific range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (e.g., -1234567890, 1234567890)
  rune => An alias for int32, represents a Unicode code point (i.e., a single character), and is used when dealing with Unicode characters (e.g., 'a', 'Ã±', 'ä¸–')
  uint32 => A 32-bit unsigned integer, an integer that can represent values from 0 to 4,294,967,295
  int64 => A 64-bit signed integer, an integer that can represent a larger range of values, specifically from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

  There also are more types like int8 or uint8 which work in the same way (=> integer with smaller number range)

- Null Values

  - All Go value types come with a so-called "null value" which is the value stored in a variable if no other value is explicitly set.
  - For example, the following int variable would have a default value of 0 (because 0 is the null value of int, int32 etc):

    ```go
    var age int // age is 0
    ```

- Here's a list of the null values for the different types:

  int => 0
  float64 => 0.0
  string => "" (i.e., an empty string)
  bool => false
